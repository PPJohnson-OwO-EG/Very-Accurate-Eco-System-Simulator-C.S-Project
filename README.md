# Very-Accurate-Eco-System-Simulator-C.S-Project-
It's a very accurate simulation of an eco-system! It contains many options for you tweak around and is actually pretty deep and random.

This is my first proper 'big' project in Python so if it's scuffed that's why.


I would reccommend launching this program by right clicking on it and opening with Python, if you don't have Python then you should install that first.

Suggestions are welcome!
